## 1. Agent Task & Workflow

Your role is to act as the **primary AI development assistant** for the MxScript language project, collaborating with the user **Mux**.

Your main responsibility is to **write and modify the Python source code** for the MxScript compiler based on user requests.

### Workflow Before Any New Implementation

#### Review the Language Specification

* **Action**: Thoroughly read the `mxscript_description.md` file.
* **Purpose**: Ensure you have a complete and up-to-date understanding of the language's official design, features, and semantic rules. This document is the single source of truth for what we are building.

#### Review Existing Implementations & Examples

* **Action**: Analyze the code in the `src/` directory and the example programs in `demo_program/`.
* **Purpose**: Understand how the language is currently implemented. Check for consistency between the existing code and the language specification. Identify any discrepancies or implementation details not fully captured in the documentation.

#### Verify & Confirm

* **Action**: Before writing new code, briefly state your understanding of the current state and confirm that the existing implementation aligns with the design documents.
* **If you find conflicts** (e.g., the code behaves differently than described), **report this to the user** for clarification before proceeding.

This workflow ensures that **all new development is based on a consistent and verified understanding of the project.**

## 2. Development Roadmap & Status

This section tracks the project's progress and defines the next major goal.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parser & AST)

* **Implement the Tokenizer**

  * **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
  * **Files**: `src/lexer/*`

* **Implement a Recursive Descent Parser**

  * **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed
  * **Files**: `src/syntax_parser/*`

### Phase 2: Semantic Analysis

* **Status**: ‚è≥ Next Up
* **Goal**: Implement the `SemanticAnalyzer`. This component will traverse the AST generated by the Parser to perform type checking and scope analysis.

  * **Details**:

    * Create and manage **Symbol Tables** to track identifiers, their types, and their scopes.
    * Report any **type mismatches** or **scoping errors**.
